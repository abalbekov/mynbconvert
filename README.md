# mynbconvert custom template

This is nbcovert custom template for saving a Jupyter notebook as html file.   
The template will:

- generate html with "classic" Jupyter look and feel
- add hide/show buttons for code and output cells
- add cell execution time taken from cell metadata stored by "executetime" Jupyter extension
- embed markdown cell images into html file as base64 encoded data
- enumerate markdown headings
- adjust REF anchors to match enumerated headings in Table of Content cell generated by "toc2" Jupyter extension.   
(I could not make toc2 extension own exporters and templates work with nbconvert v6+, therefore included this functionality as a workaround)

The custom Jinja2 template name is "custom_template".   
The template extends "classic" html template.   
The template relies on several jinja2 filters implemented as functions in a custom exporter.   
The exporter name is "custom_exporter.AddFilters", implemented in Python package "custom_exporter".   
Therefore nbconvert needs to be called with both "--to" and "--template" parameters :

```jupyter nbconvert mynotebook.ipynb --to=custom_exporter.AddFilters --template custom_template```

Works with nbconvert v6+
